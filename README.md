## Key Challenges in IoT Applications:
1. Data Scarcity: Limited datasets for training deep learning models.
2. Privacy Concerns: Sensitive real-world data, such as healthcare IoT data (e.g., ECG).

## Solutions via Deep Learning:
1. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic data generation to augment small datasets.
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for real-time signal classification and object detection.
3. Advanced Frameworks like YOLOv8 and Detectron2 for real-time object detection and segmentation.
